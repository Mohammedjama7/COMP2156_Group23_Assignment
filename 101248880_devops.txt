Through this Program I have worked alot with Git and enjoy the seemless work envorment it allows on mac 

I have also wokred through Vs code to develop websites earlier in the program, so i appreciate that tool in comparison to Webstormø

My goal for this semeser is to get more comfortable working in a Git enviormnet as i didnt have much expereince with it prior and to become more confident in my ablilities as a worker in this enviorment. m
